# AI Location Music Recommender (AI-LMR)

An AI-powered song recommender.

Based on a destination city as an input, the AI-LMR is capable of recommending a tune that's related to that destination.

We converse via chain-of-thought with a LLM hosted in Amazon Bedrock, and we connect to the Spotify API to get relevant information about the music.

The API is hosted in an AWS Lambda.
